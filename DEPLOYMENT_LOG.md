# DEPLOYMENT LOG - CRITICAL ISSUE
**Problem**: Updates are not actually deploying to the website despite deployment counter showing v3
**Goal**: Get current local version with population fix deployed to live website
**Success criteria**: Deployment number appears on right side status bar

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. **Attempt 1**: Fixed population logic in risk_engine.py, committed, pushed
   - Result: Health endpoint shows deployment_version: 3
   - BUT: Website status bar does not show deployment number
   - Status: FAILED - not actually deployed

2. **Attempt 2**: Multiple monitors checking deployment status
   - Result: All show "deployment complete" but changes not live
   - Status: FAILED - false positive monitoring

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Local code has correct population fix
- Health endpoint returns deployment_version: 3
- BUT website status bar missing deployment number = NOT DEPLOYED
- API still has old behavior in production

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
3. **Attempt 3**: Browser verification of website status bar
   - Result: System Status shows "Meridian Intelligence Platform - Demo"
   - NO deployment number visible on right side
   - Status: CONFIRMED FAILURE - deployment not live

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
4. **Attempt 4**: Deployment v4 - Force deployment with population fix
   - Result: 502 Bad Gateway error - deployment failed completely
   - Website completely down
   - Status: CRITICAL FAILURE

## CURRENT CRISIS:
- Website showing 502 Bad Gateway
- Deployment v4 broke the entire service
- Need to revert or fix immediately

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
5. **Attempt 5**: Check deployment v4 status after recovery
   - Result: Website loads normally again (502 resolved)
   - BUT: Status bar STILL shows "Meridian Intelligence Platform - Demo"
   - NO deployment number "4" visible on right side
   - Status: FAILED - deployment counter still missing

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Website is accessible again (502 error resolved)
- BUT deployment number STILL not visible on status bar
- This confirms deployment v4 changes are NOT actually live
- Need to investigate why deployment counter is not displaying

## NEXT STEPS:
- Check health endpoint to verify deployment version in API
- Investigate frontend code for status bar implementation
- Try deployment v5 with potential frontend fixes
