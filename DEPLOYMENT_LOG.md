# DEPLOYMENT LOG - CRITICAL ISSUE
**Problem**: Updates are not actually deploying to the website despite deployment counter showing v3
**Goal**: Get current local version with population fix deployed to live website
**Success criteria**: Deployment number appears on right side status bar

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. **Attempt 1**: Fixed population logic in risk_engine.py, committed, pushed
   - Result: Health endpoint shows deployment_version: 3
   - BUT: Website status bar does not show deployment number
   - Status: FAILED - not actually deployed

2. **Attempt 2**: Multiple monitors checking deployment status
   - Result: All show "deployment complete" but changes not live
   - Status: FAILED - false positive monitoring

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Local code has correct population fix
- Health endpoint returns deployment_version: 3
- BUT website status bar missing deployment number = NOT DEPLOYED
- API still has old behavior in production

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
3. **Attempt 3**: Browser verification of website status bar
   - Result: System Status shows "Meridian Intelligence Platform - Demo"
   - NO deployment number visible on right side
   - Status: CONFIRMED FAILURE - deployment not live

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
4. **Attempt 4**: Deployment v4 - Force deployment with population fix
   - Result: 502 Bad Gateway error - deployment failed completely
   - Website completely down
   - Status: CRITICAL FAILURE

## CURRENT CRISIS:
- Website showing 502 Bad Gateway
- Deployment v4 broke the entire service
- Need to revert or fix immediately

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
5. **Attempt 5**: Check deployment v4 status after recovery
   - Result: Website loads normally again (502 resolved)
   - BUT: Status bar STILL shows "Meridian Intelligence Platform - Demo"
   - NO deployment number "4" visible on right side
   - Status: FAILED - deployment counter still missing

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Website is accessible again (502 error resolved)
- BUT deployment number STILL not visible on status bar
- This confirms deployment v4 changes are NOT actually live
- Need to investigate why deployment counter is not displaying

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
6. **Attempt 6**: Deployment v5 - Deployment counter fix
   - Result: Health endpoint shows deployment_version: 5
   - Website status bar shows "Deployment: v5" correctly
   - Status: SUCCESS - deployment counter now working
   - BUT: API still returns population: "mixed" instead of "adult"
   - Status: PARTIAL SUCCESS - counter works but population fix missing

## CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUE:
- Deployment counter system is now working (v5 visible on website)
- BUT population classification fix is STILL NOT DEPLOYED
- API returns population: "mixed" when it should return "adult"
- This means the risk_engine.py population fixes never actually went live

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:
The deployment counter system works, proving deployments ARE happening.
The population fix in risk_engine.py is NOT live, meaning either:
1. The code wasn't actually committed/pushed properly
2. There's a deployment caching issue preventing new code from loading
3. The fixes were overwritten by another deployment

## SOLUTION APPROACH:
Need to re-implement and force-deploy the population classification fix

## HOW WE FIXED THE DEPLOYMENT COUNTER ISSUE:
**Problem**: Deployment counter not visible on website status bar
**Solution**: Modified JavaScript in app_simple.py to fetch /api/health and display deployment version prominently
**Key Code Change**: Added prominent blue "Deployment: vX" display in status panel
**Success Criteria**: Deployment number visible on right side of status bar
**Verification**: Browser shows "Deployment: v5" after deployment v5 goes live
