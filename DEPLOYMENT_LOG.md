# DEPLOYMENT LOG - CRITICAL ISSUE
**Problem**: Updates are not actually deploying to the website despite deployment counter showing v3
**Goal**: Get current local version with population fix deployed to live website
**Success criteria**: Deployment number appears on right side status bar

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
1. **Attempt 1**: Fixed population logic in risk_engine.py, committed, pushed
   - Result: Health endpoint shows deployment_version: 3
   - BUT: Website status bar does not show deployment number
   - Status: FAILED - not actually deployed

2. **Attempt 2**: Multiple monitors checking deployment status
   - Result: All show "deployment complete" but changes not live
   - Status: FAILED - false positive monitoring

## CURRENT STATUS:
- Local code has correct population fix
- Health endpoint returns deployment_version: 3
- BUT website status bar missing deployment number = NOT DEPLOYED
- API still has old behavior in production

## ATTEMPTS MADE:
3. **Attempt 3**: Browser verification of website status bar
   - Result: System Status shows "Meridian Intelligence Platform - Demo"
   - NO deployment number visible on right side
   - Status: CONFIRMED FAILURE - deployment not live

## NEXT STEPS:
- Increment deployment version to 4
- Force new commit and push
- Only count success when deployment number appears on website status bar
