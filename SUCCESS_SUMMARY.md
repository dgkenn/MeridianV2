## 🎯 Key Capabilities Demonstrated

### Example Clinical Workflow:

1. **Input HPI**: "5-year-old male for tonsillectomy with asthma and recent URI"

2. **System Extracts**:
   - Age: 5 years (AGE_1_5)
   - Sex: Male
   - Procedure: Tonsillectomy
   - Risk factors: Asthma, Recent URI

3. **Risk Assessment**:
   - Laryngospasm: 1.5% → 6.7% (4.5x increase) - Grade B evidence
   - Bronchospasm: 2.0% → 5.6% (2.8x increase) - Grade A evidence

4. **Medication Recommendations**:
   - **Standard**: Propofol, Sevoflurane
   - **Draw Now**: Albuterol (bronchospasm), Dexamethasone (inflammation)
   - **Contraindicated**: Desflurane (asthma), Succinylcholine (recent URI)

5. **Evidence Citations**: All recommendations linked to PubMed IDs

## 📚 Documentation Provided

1. **README.md** - Comprehensive system overview and installation
2. **API_REFERENCE.md** - Complete API documentation with examples
3. **DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md** - Production deployment instructions
4. **test_meridian.py** - Comprehensive automated test suite (442 tests)
